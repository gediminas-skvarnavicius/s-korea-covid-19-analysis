<p>During this period several important policies took were implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special immigration procedures for visitors from China, Macau and Hong Kong were implemented, these included visa free entry suspension, quarantine and testing procedures.</li>
<li>Authorization of diagnostic kits from two manufacturers alongside a release of a self-diagnosis app.</li>
<li>The infectious Disease Alert was raised by two levels orange (2020-01-28) and red (2020-02-23). These levels allowed the government to take special measures. At the orange level more rigorous testing was begun alongside issuing of masks and recommendations for schools. At level red the size of social gathering was limited. Contacts were traced and exposed individuals were isolated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these measures increased the rates of testing and social awareness. As a result the number of new cases decreased the following week and then started to sharply increase. The decrease was more likely to be noise in the data as the number of cases was very low at the time. What the policies did achieve was increase the rate of testing weekly done tests in <a href="#fig-tests-time">Figure&nbsp;2</a>. The search trend data in <a href="#fig-search-trends-time">Figure&nbsp;3</a> shows that the public was already aware of the coronavirus after the blue and yellow alertness levels were raised, therefore, the increase in testing is mostly do to the availability of tests. The surge in tests also coincided with the surge in confirmed cases, this is means that before the package of policies was implemented it is possible that a large number of cases was not diagnosed prior.</p>

<p>During this period several important policies were implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>A national social distancing campaign was launched that issued guidelines on social distancing on 2020-02-29 that included working from home, wearing masks, staying at home as much as possible.</li>
<li>Daycare centers were closed.</li>
<li>Schools were not opened on March (in South Korea March is the beginning of a semester after a winter break Dec-Feb).</li>
<li>Special immigrations procedures were implemented for visitors from largest outbreak countries.</li>
<li>Drive-trough screening centers were opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>These measures, especially the school closure severely restricted social contacts. After the implementation of these measures a sharp decrease in new cases was observed as seen in <a href="#fig-tests-time">Figure&nbsp;2</a> .</p>

<p>Respiratory infections are often related to weather conditions. The data sets provides a number of meterological parameters. Yet the literature shows that the temperature alone is the best predictor of respiratory infections (<span class="citation" data-cites="falagas2008">Falagas et al.

(<a href="#ref-carder2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>) therefore in order to compare the weather conditions with the timeline of South Korean covid-19 situation I’ve aggregated the dataset into weekly averages of temperature across the country. The resulting comparison can be seen in <a href="#fig-temp-time">Figure&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

<p>The data shows that there is a significant correlation between the number of new cases and the 5-day prior temperature especially after the peak, when the number of cases started to subside. A significant negative correlation between new covid-19 cases was observed in most of the northern hemisphere regions with seasonal climate (<span class="citation" data-cites="mcclymont2021">McClymont and Hu (<a href="#ref-mcclymont2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>). This means that warming of the weather might have caused an additional beneficial effect in the lowering of new covid-19 cases. The effects of humidity and wind speed may also be significant but the results in the literature are far mor ambiguous and therefore this data was not included in this analysis.</p>
